# cl-pentothal
Find the TRUTH about your code!

CL-pentothal is a unit testing framework distinguished by its lack of features and lack of abilities. You can pound your head against a wall trying to learn someone else's Common Lisp testing framework by reading the (mostly) non-existent documentation... or you can write your own in half the time. CL-pentothal is an example of the latter.
